Understanding of the Problem

Newcomers getting into fitness are often intimidated by the process and have a hard time sticking with their fitness goals. Through research, we’ve found web applications that address this issue through an article or blog-post. Some forums, such as bodybuilding.com, have a community of people that can share comments and opinions under topics. There are also studios that offer beginner fitness classes, including boxing, yoga, weightlifting, and spin. This project will make beginners’ lives easier by providing an app where they can interact, share tips, and achieve their goals with other beginners.

Scope of Project

First feature: Ability to set diet and exercise regimens and monitor calorie intake and output on a daily basis. Users will be able to login to their account and set up exercise schedules for themselves as well as dietary plans.

Second feature: Users will be able to monitor their progress on a weekly, biweekly and monthly basis to see if they are meeting their goals.

Third feature: Tracker that displays graphically each user’s progress in relation to their set goals. Metrics to be tracked can be distance walked, sets and reps of an exercise regimen, as well as calories consumed and burned.

Fourth feature: Users will earn points based on how much of the goals they were able to keep. Then the users will be put on leaderboards based on their points. This will make a competitive environment among users. There will be many leaderboards of different kinds so users can be top on different categories.

Fifth feature: Users have the ability to browse other users’ profiles which includes diet/exercise regimens, goals and progress. They will have the ability to copy a regimen to their own profile.

Sixth feature: User will be able to invite other users to their exercise regimens. This will include the ability to set the time and place of the activity in the web app (say the events page).

Seventh feature: Users will be able to post to a forum to share their success stories and fitness routines in a more elaborate way. Users will be able to edit and delete their own posts and only view the posts of other users. Admins will be able to edit or delete the post of any user.

As a regular user of the site, you will be able to login to the site and be authenticated as an existing user. As such, your profile and recent statistics will appear on the main landing page. From there, you will be able to navigate to other features such as the calorie count, tracker, leaderboards and so on. A regular user would use this app to motivate themselves to reach their fitness goals by unlocking different achievements as well as the social pressures of other users meeting their fitness goals. In this way, regular users can continue to set new benchmarks and share their routines with others that helped them reach their personal goals. In this way, GitFit promotes a very social way to improve personal physical fitness.

As an admin of the site, you will be able to add, edit and delete existing users from the site. This means that an admin will be able to add users directly when logged in. Furthermore, admins will be able to edit user information including their name, email and any other profile information stored in the database.
